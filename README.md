# ICHack24 - SoldierOn

This is SoldierOn for the ICHack24 for the HealthTech category, sponsored by
Terra API.

SoldierOn is an AI powered dashboard to monitor soldier wellbeing. Different
people have different daily rhythms; some are night owls, some are early birds,
etc. It would be nice to have and utilize such data to plan for in day-to-day
training or active duty scheduling to maximize the effectiveness the military
can get from such tasks.

Measuring wellness (both mental and physical) from an aggregate of metrics
provided by Terra API, SoldierOn provides the following to military commanders:

1. An overall dashboard showcasing the aggregated metrics of the people under
their command.

2. A scheduler to plan shifts for duty or training, taking into account when a
soldier performs the best.

3. Prediction modeling, using TimeGPT, the aggregate wellness score to act as a
metric for fast decision making.
